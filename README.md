This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/_app.tsx` and related files under `src/components`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Blockchain Integration (Frontend <-> Backend):
A project-specific token, Tokens & Smiles token (TST) is generated and is used to claim rewards from flights. The claimed amount of tokens is calculated according to the distance between departure and arrival airports in miles. Currently, live data is not used for the calculation and therefore, `src/components/flight_data.json` is created and used for this purpose but in the future, it will be replaced with the real data

## Idea:
To address these challenges, we propose Tokens & Smiles, a decentralized loyalty program that offers a unified and transparent rewards system for airline customers. By leveraging blockchain technology, Tokens & Smiles ensures fair and consistent rewards for all users, regardless of their airline or banking affiliations.

## Value Proposition:
The core value proposition of Tokens & Smiles lies in its ability to provide a seamless and rewarding experience for airline customers. 
By offering a unified rewards system that is decentralized and transparent, Tokens & Smiles fills a crucial gap in the market, empowering users to maximize their rewards and enhance their travel experience.

## Future Plans:
Looking ahead, we plan to further enhance Tokens & Smiles by introducing personalized NFTs tied to user profiles and flight history. 
These NFTs will enable users to claim rewards and access exclusive benefits based on their travel patterns. 

Additionally, we aim to expand our partnerships with airlines and integrate new features to make Tokens & Smiles the go-to loyalty program for frequent flyers worldwide.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, Tokens & Smiles represents the future of airline loyalty programs, offering a decentralized and inclusive platform that puts the power back into the hands of the users. 
With its innovative approach and commitment to customer satisfaction, Tokens & Smiles is poised to revolutionize the way we earn and redeem rewards in the travel industry.
